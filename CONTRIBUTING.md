## Roadmap

The roadmap is just a ranking of the currently open issues and no hard dates are set at this point for any fix or new feature.

I (Michael) am the BDFL of the project and can and will arbitrarily rank issues according to my own needs (and those of my [employer](https://www.definite.app)) but for the most part I try to evaluate priority of issues based on an [Impact-Effort Analysis](https://github.com/mharrisb1/iea).
